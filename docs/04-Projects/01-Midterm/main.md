# Midterm project

## Description
Develop and present an example of time series analysis using an open-source python package specialized to time series or offering interesting functionality relevant for working with time series data.

__Note__: The package you present should <u>not</u> be one of those we use in the course, i.e. [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/index.html) or [arch](https://arch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Also, what it does should not deviate too much from the type of analysis and models covered in the course. That is, it should not be designed exclusively for implementing, for example, Bayesian analysis or Deep learning applied to time series models. 

I will provide a list of possible packages for you to consider, but you're free to use others. In any case, you will have to send me a brief description of what you propose to do, and I will approve each project. There can be no two projects using the same package, and the approval will be given on a first-come-first-served basis.

For an overview/comparison of many python packages for time series, see [here](https://siebert-julien.github.io/time-series-analysis-python/overview.html) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07406))
